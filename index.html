			<h3><a href="#">How Long Do Goldfish Live?</a></h3>
			<div>
				<p>Goldfish kept in a bowl have the shortest lifespan, 5 years being exceptional. If goldfish are kept outdoors in a pond, attain a good size and are fed the proper diet, 20 years is not uncommon.  In China goldfish over 40 years old have been recorded.</p>
			</div>
			<h3><a href="#">What Should I Feed My Goldfish?</a></h3>
			<div>
				<p>Goldfish are omnivorous meaning they eat vegetable and animal based foods, so a balanced diet containing both is essential. Fancy varieties require a high proportion of live food in their diet otherwise they will develop intestinal problems leading to swimming imbalance.</p>
			</div>
			<h3><a href="#">How Big Do Goldfish Grow?</a></h3>
			<div>
				<p>The conditions goldfish are kept in plus their diet determine how large they will grow. They can grow very large in very small containers when their water is changed frequently.  Goldfish will not grow if water conditions are poor.</p>
			</div>
			<h3><a href="#">How Can I Tell If My Goldfish Is Male or Female?</a></h3>
			<div>
				<p>The fish must be at least a year old, and in excellent health.  They must be fed high quality dry food but ideally live food.  Their water must be clean and the temperature somewhere above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Under these conditions goldfish will start to display characteristics of male and female. Males will develop small raised white tubercles on their gill plates and the leading edges of their pectoral fins. When viewed from above, females will look more rounded compared to the males.</p>
